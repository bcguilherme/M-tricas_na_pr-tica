# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of telecom customer information to understand customer churn. Customer churn refers to when customers leave a service or stop using a product. In this analysis, we explore the factors that influence customer churn and build a predictive model to identify potential churn risks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains the following columns:

- `customerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `tenure`: Number of months a customer has been with the company.
- `PhoneService`: Whether the customer has a phone service (Yes/No).
- `Contract`: The type of contract the customer has (e.g., Month-to-month, One year).
- `PaperlessBilling`: Whether the customer has paperless billing (Yes/No).
- `PaymentMethod`: The method of payment (e.g., Electronic check, Mailed check).
- `MonthlyCharges`: The monthly charges for the customer.
- `TotalCharges`: The total charges incurred by the customer.
- `Churn`: Whether the customer churned (Yes/No).
